function in the original package is as following: The main purpose of this
function is to test whether the missing data mechanism, for an incompletely
observed data set, is one of missing completely at random (MCAR). As a by
product, however, this package has the capabilities of imputing incomplete
data, performing a test to determine whether data have a multivariate normal
distribution, performing a test of equality of covariances for groups, and
obtaining normal-theory maximum likelihood estimates for mean and covariance
when data are incomplete. The test of MCAR follows the methodology proposed
by Jamshidian and Jalal (2010). It is based on testing equality of
covariances between groups having identical missing data patterns. The data
are imputed, using two options of normality and distribution free, and the
test of equality of covariances between groups with identical missing data
patterns is performed also with options of assuming normality (Hawkins test)
or non-parametrically. Users can optionally use their own method of data
imputation as well. Multiple imputation is an additional feature of the
program that can be used as a diagnostic tool to help identify cases or
variables that contribute to rejection of MCAR, when the MCAR test is
rejected (See Jamshidian and Jalal, 2010 for details). As explained in
Jamshidian, Jalal, and Jansen (2014), this package can also be used for
imputing missing data, test of multivariate normality, and test of equality
of covariances between several groups when data are completly observed."><!-- mathjax --><script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/mathjax/2.7.5/MathJax.js" integrity="sha256-nvJJv9wWKEm88qvoQl9ekL2J+k/RWIsaSScxxlsrv8k=" crossorigin="anonymous"></script><script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/mathjax/2.7.5/config/TeX-AMS-MML_HTMLorMML.js" integrity="sha256-84DKXVJXs0/F8OTMzX4UR909+jtl4G7SPypPavF+GfA=" crossorigin="anonymous"></script><!--[if lt IE 9]>

    <h2>Arguments</h2>
    <dl><dt>data</dt>
<dd><p>A matrix or data frame consisting of at least two columns.
Values must be numerical with missing data indicated by NA.</p></dd>
<dt>del.lesscases</dt>
<dd><p>Missing data patterns consisting of del.lesscases number
of cases or less will be removed from the data set.</p></dd>
<dt>imputation.number</dt>
<dd><p>Number of imputations to be used, if data are to be
multiply imputed.</p></dd>
<dt>method</dt>
<dd><p>method is an option that allows the user to select one of the
methods of Hawkins or nonparametric for the test.
If the user is certain that data have multivariate normal distribution, the
method="Hawkins" should be selected.
On the other hand if data are not normally distributed,
then method="Nonparametric" should be used. If the user is unsure, then the
default value of method="Auto" will be used, in which case both the Hawkins
and the nonparametric tests will be run, and the default output follows the
recommendation by Jamshidian and Jalal (2010) outlined in their flowchart
given in Figure 7 of their paper.</p></dd>
<dt>imputation.method</dt>
<dd><p>"Dist.Free": Missing data are imputed
nonparametrically using the method of Sirvastava and Dolatabadi (2009);
also see Jamshidian and Jalal (2010).</p>
<p>"normal": Missing data are imputed assuming that the data come from a
multivariate normal distribution. The maximum likelihood estimate of the mean
and covariance obtained from Mls is used for generating imputed values.
The imputed values are based on the conditional distribution of the missing
variables given the observed variables; see Jamshidian and Jalal (2010) for
more details.</p></dd>
<dt>nrep</dt>
<dd><p>Number of replications used to simulate the Neyman distribution
to determine the cut off value for the Neyman test in the program SimNey.
 Larger values increase the accuracy of the Neyman test.</p></dd>
<dt>n.min</dt>
<dd><p>The minimum number of cases in a group that triggers the use of
asymptotic Chi distribution in place of the emprical distribution in the
Neyman test of uniformity.</p></dd>
<dt>seed</dt>
<dd><p>An initial random number generator seed. The default is 110 that
can be reset to a user selected number. If the value is set to NA, a system
selected seed is used.</p></dd>
<dt>alpha</dt>
<dd><p>The significance level at which tests are performed.</p></dd>
<dt>imputed.data</dt>
<dd><p>The user can optionally provide an imputed data set.
In this case the program will not impute the data and will use the imputed
data set for the tests performed.
Note that the order of cases in the imputed data set should be the same as
that of the incomplete data set.</p></dd>

<code>patcnt</code> A vector consisting the number of cases corresponding
to each pattern in patused.
<code>patused</code> A matrix indicating the missing data patterns in the
